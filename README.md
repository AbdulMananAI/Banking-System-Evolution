🚀 Project Overview
This is a comprehensive cmd based banking application that manages user accounts, transactions, and data persistence. It serves as a foundation for understanding how real-world financial software handles data security and logic flow.

🛠️ Current Features (C++ Legacy Version)
User Authentication: Secure signup and login system.

Transaction Logic: Deposits, withdrawals, and real-time balance checks.

Data Persistence: Uses File Handling (.txt) to save and retrieve account data locally.

Input Validation: Basic password and account number verification.

📅 Roadmap For future updates
[x] Phase 1: Functional C++ implementation with File Handling (Current).

[ ] Phase 2: Complete Python OOP rewrite with enhanced class structures.

[ ] Phase 3: Integration of JSON or Database for advanced data management.

[ ] Phase 4: GUI implementation for a modern user experience.
